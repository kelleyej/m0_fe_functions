# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am most proud of getting more practice in and already starting to feel like I'm gaining muscle memory with certain lines of code. 
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
They call for action! And give the program instructions on what to do and how to perform.
